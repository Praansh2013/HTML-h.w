<h2>Here is all the buzz about the Honeybees</h2> <br>
<p>Honeybees live in <b>colonies</b> with one queen running the whole hive.Many species still occur in the wild, but honeybees are disappearing from hives due to colony collapse disorder.
Scientists are not sure what is causing this collapse.

Honeybees are important pollinators for flowers, fruits, and vegetables. They live on stored honey and pollen all winter
and cluster into a ball to conserve warmth. All honeybees are social and cooperative insects. Members of the hive are
divided into three types. Workers forage for food (pollen and nectar from flowers), build and protect the hive, clean,
and circulate air by beating their wings. The queen's job is simple—she lays the eggs that will spawn the hive's next
generation of bees. There is usually only a single queen in a hive. If the queen dies, workers will create a new queen
by feeding one of the worker females a special food called "royal jelly." This elixir enables the worker to develop into
a fertile queen. Worker honeybees are all females and are the only bees
most people ever see flying around outside of the hive. They forage for food, build the honeycombs, and protect the
hive.Queens regulate the hive's activities by producing chemicals that guide the behavior of the other bees. Male bees are
called drones—the third class of honeybee. Several hundred drones live in each hive during the spring and summer, but
they are expelled for the winter months when the hive goes into a lean <i>survival</i> mode.

<h2>Why are Honeybees important</h2>
<p>Honey bees are important because <mark>they pollinate crops and produce hive products such as honey.</mark> They are also a vital part of the environment and human culture.</p>

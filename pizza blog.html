<h1>What is Pizza?</h1>
<p>
    Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil,
    oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial
    setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.The word pizza is believed to be from an Old Italian word meaning “a point,” which in turn became the Italian word
    “pizzicare,” which means “to pinch” or “pluck.”<mark>In one of its many forms, pizza has been a basic part of the Italian diet since the Stone Age.</mark> <u>A small pizza is sometimes called pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. The word pizza was
    borrowed from Italian into English in the 1930s; before it became well known, pizza was called "tomato pie" by English
    speakers. Some regional pizza variations still use the name tomato pie.</u>

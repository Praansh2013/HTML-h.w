                <h2>Bengali cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                   <strong> Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle yet complex flavours, with a perfect balance of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy
                    tastes. The use of mustard oil, panch phoron (a blend of five whole spices), and the fragrant spice blend garam masala
                    impart a distinct aroma and taste to the dishes.</strong>

                        The cuisine of Bihar is very wholesome. Dal and bhat is the staple food of Bihar like many other parts of India. And
                        mustard oil along with spices like cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, fennel seeds, carom seeds and red
                        chillies are commonly used in cooking.

                    <p>
                        <strong>

                            for its meat dishes, and is influenced by Persian, Central Asian, and Indian culinary traditions.

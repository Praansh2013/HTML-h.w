                <h2>Bengali cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                   <strong> Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle yet complex flavours, with a perfect balance of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy
                    tastes. The use of mustard oil, panch phoron (a blend of five whole spices), and the fragrant spice blend garam masala
                    impart a distinct aroma and taste to the dishes.</strong>

                <h2>Bihari cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The cuisine of Bihar is very wholesome. Dal and bhat is the staple food of Bihar like many other parts of India. And
                        mustard oil along with spices like cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, fennel seeds, carom seeds and red
                        chillies are commonly used in cooking.

                    <h2>Kashmiri cuisine</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Kashmiri cuisine is a rich and flavorful cuisine that reflects the region's history and cultural exchanges. It's known
                            for its meat dishes, and is influenced by Persian, Central Asian, and Indian culinary traditions.

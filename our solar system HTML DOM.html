The Earth is the only planet that supports life because of the availability of air, water, and gases needed for survival. The climate of the Earth is mild. However, due to the overuse and wastage of resources, the planet is in danger, and global warming is increasing. This is affecting the survival conditions for human beings and all living things. In order to save our Earth, we will have to take major steps to conserve what is left on the planet because life is not possible on other planets"
